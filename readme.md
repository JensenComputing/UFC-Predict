# Optimize one-class SVM outlier model

    - Use the retired, non-UFC fighters to train the outlier model. The retired and active UFC fighters can serve in the validation and test sets.
    - Get the distributions of win % in the validation set. Optimize for a threshold to reclassify outliers with low win %.
    - Optimize one class parameters gamma and nu for the rbf kernel.
    - Explore predictions.
